%description
LPrint implements printing for a variety of common label and receipt printers
connected via network or USB.  Features include:

- A single executable handles spooling, status, and server functionality.
- Multiple printer support.
- Each printer implements an IPP Everywhereâ„¢ print service and is compatible
  with the driverless printing support in iOS, macOS, and Linux clients.
- Each printer can support options such as label modes, tear-off offsets,
  media tracking, media top offset, print darkness, resolution, roll
  selection, and speed.
- Each printer can print "raw", Apple/PWG Raster, and/or PNG files.

For more information, see the file "DOCUMENTATION.md", the man pages in the
"man" directory, and/or the LPrint project page at
"https://www.msweet.org/lprint".
