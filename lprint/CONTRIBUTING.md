Contributing to LPrint
======================

I'm happy to accept changes into LPrint.  For new drivers, I ask that
contributors provide me with a printer and supplies that would allow me to
debug any issues *and/or* commit to providing assistance on any issues that
are reported on Github.

Contributions should be submitted as pull requests on the
[LPrint Github project](https://github.com/michaelrsweet/lprint).  New code
MUST be supplied under the existing LPrint license (Apache 2.0).
